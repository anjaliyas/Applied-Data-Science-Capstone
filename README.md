# Applied Data Science Capstone project - Predicting Falcon 9 rocket landing outcomes 

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
## Objectives
- Data collection using relevant APIs and webscraping
- Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine launch features and encode landing outcomes
- Data visualisation (including interactive mapping and dashboarding) to display trends in launch outcomes by different launch factors
- Predictive classification model training and testing to determine the best method for predicting landing outcomes by launch factors
